          Ashtanga Yoga is a highly structured and intense form of yoga, known
          for its specific sequence of postures linked by breath. Each posture
          is held for a set amount of time, creating a steady flow that builds
          heat and endurance in the body. This practice not only enhances
          physical strength and flexibility but also promotes mental focus and
          inner tranquility.
