            With over fifteen years of practice and teaching, Joseph has
            developed a deep understanding of this dynamic and physically
            demanding style of yoga. He emphasizes the importance of precision
            and alignment in each pose, building strength, stamina, and
            flexibility through a methodical progression of postures. Joseph is
            committed to preserving the purity of Ashtanga's ancient techniques
            while adapting them to suit modern practitioners. His classes are
            challenging yet accessible, designed to empower students to push
            their limits safely and with purpose. Josephâ€™s passion for Ashtanga
            yoga shines through as he leads his students towards physical and
            mental resilience, making every class a journey of self-discovery
            and personal growth.
